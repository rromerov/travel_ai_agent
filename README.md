# AI Travel Agent

> [!TIP] This project was built using Python 3.12. For a better experience, you can install Python 3.12 using this command:

```
uv python install 3.12
```

To install all necessary dependencies you can either can use a `virtual environment` or `uv`. 

## Using Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment in the current directory:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you can install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Using uv
If you have `uv` installed, you can install the dependencies with:
```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

>[!NOTE] If you are using `uv`, you can skip the virtual environment setup as `uv` will handle it for you.
